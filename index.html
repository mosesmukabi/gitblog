    <h1>Get started</h1>
    <p>To get started with Git, the first step is to set up your development environment. Begin by creating a folder on your computer where you'll store your project files. Next, you'll need to download a code editor, like Visual Studio Code (VS Code), if you don't have one installed already. It's a powerful tool that will make your coding experience smoother. Once you have VS Code installed, you'll need to ensure that Git is also installed on your machine. If you don’t already have a GitHub account, now is the perfect time to create one at GitHub. This will allow you to store your code online, collaborate with others, and keep track of changes. With Git, GitHub, and VS Code ready to go, you're set for an efficient and organized development process</p>
    <h1>What is Git</h1>
    <p>Git is an <strong>open-source version control system (VCS),</strong> widely used by developers to manage and track changes in their code. In simple terms, a version control system allows multiple people to work on the same project, keeping track of every modification made over time. With Git, you can revert to previous versions of your code, track who made specific changes, and collaborate on projects seamlessly. <br> <br>
    A <strong>version control system</strong> helps maintain different versions of files, whether it's code, documents, or any other type of project. It allows you to:
    <ul>
        <li>Track changes made by different contributors.</li>
        <li>Revert to previous states in case something goes wrong.</li>
        <li>Create multiple branches to work on new features without affecting the main project.</li>
    </ul><br>
    In this blog, the focus will be on Git and GitHub. Git, paired with GitHub, creates a powerful workflow for developers to collaborate, share, and manage projects efficiently. Whether you're working alone or with a team, Git and GitHub are essential tools for modern software development.

    </p>
    <h1>installing Git</h1>
    <p>Before we dive into using Git, the first step is to check whether it’s already installed on your machine. Here's how you can verify that:</p>
    <h3>Checking if Git is Installed</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Open your terminal or command prompt.</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>On Windows, press Win + R, type cmd, and hit Enter.</li>
            <li>On macOS, press Cmd + Space, type "Terminal", and hit Enter.</li>
            <li>On Linux, open the terminal from your applications menu.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Run the following command to check if Git is installed:</strong></li>
        <p>After oppening the command prompt type this comand <strong>git --version</strong> then hit enter</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="imgs/git version.png" alt="checking git version code">
            <figcaption><i>this is a command to check whether git is installed</i></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>if the version of the git is dispayed then you are more than ready to proceed if not you can follow the steps below</p>
    </ol>
    <h3>Installing Git (if not installed)</h3>
    <p>If Git is not installed on your machine, follow the steps below based on your operating system:</p>
    <h4>For Windows:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Go to the official Git website: <a href="https://git-scm.com/." target="_blank">click here</a></li>
        <li>Click on the "Download for Windows" button.</li>
        <li>Once downloaded, run the installer and follow the default setup instructions. Make sure to leave options as default unless you have specific needs.</li>
        <li>Verify the installation by checking the Git version using <strong>git --version</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Configuring Git</h1>
    <p>After successfully installing Git, it's important to configure your Git environment by setting your username and email address. These details will be associated with every commit you make, helping identify the author of changes in a project. Let's walk through how to configure these settings.</p>
    <h3>Step 1: Setting your Username</h3>
    <p>To set your username, open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command <strong>git config --global user.name "Your Name"</strong>:</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="imgs/name config.png" alt="configuring name comand">
        <figcaption><i>Configuring Git with username</i></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Replace "Your Name" with your actual name. This will be used to identify you in your Git commits.</p>
    <h3>Step 2: Setting your Email Address</h3>
    <p>Next, you need to set the email address that will be associated with your commits. Use this command <strong>git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"</strong>:</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="imgs/emai config.png" alt="email configaration command">
        <figcaption><i>Configuring Git with email</i></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Make sure to replace "your.email@example.com" with the email address you want to associate with your commits. This email is especially important when you’re working with GitHub, as it links your commits to your GitHub profile.</p>
    <h3>Step 3: Verifying Your Configuration</h3>
    <p>Once you've set your username and email, you can verify your configuration with the following command <strong>Once you've set your username and email, you can verify your configuration with the following command:</strong>:</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="imgs/verifying.png" alt="command for verifying configuration">
        <figcaption><i>verifying git configaration</i></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>This command will display a list of the configuration settings you've just applied, including your username and email. With these simple steps, your Git environment is now configured, and you’re ready to start making commits that are properly attributed to you!</p>
    <h1>Initializing a Git Repository</h1>
    A Git repository is a storage space where your project’s files and their entire version history are tracked. It allows you to make changes to your code, save those changes, and revert back to previous versions if needed. Every project you work on in Git starts with a repository. When you initialize a Git repository, Git starts tracking the changes you make to the files in that folder. Let’s walk through how to create and initialize a Git repository.
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Create a New Project Folder</strong></li>
        <p>Before initializing a Git repository, create a new folder for your project.</p>
        <p>Open the foder you created on the step above then cick on the path area of the foder and type <strong>cmd</strong> to open the command prompt on that folder</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="imgs/oppening cmd.png" alt="">
            <figcaption><i>how to open cmd on the project folder</i></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <li><strong>Initialize the Git Repository</strong></li>
        <p>Once inside the project folder, you can initialize the Git repository by running <strong>git init</strong>:</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="imgs/git init.png" alt="git initializing">
            <figcaption><i>Command to initialize a Git repository.</i></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>This command creates a hidden .git directory, where Git will store the history and information about your project. <br> To check whether you Initialized you can use the command <strong>git status</strong> which will display the information that there nothing commit</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="imgs/confirm git init.png" alt="image showing git status comand">
            <figcaption><i>your Git repository has been successfully initialized if you see this</i></figcaption>
        </figure>
    </ol>
<h1>Adding Files to the Staging Area</h1>
<p>After initializing a Git repository, the next step is to add your project files to Git's <strong>staging area</strong>. But what is a staging area, and why is it important?</p>
<h4>What is a stanging area</h4>
<p>The staging area in Git is like a holding area where you can organize the changes you want to commit. It allows you to review changes before they are permanently recorded in the project’s history (through a commit). You can think of it as a preview of what will be included in your next commit. When you modify a file, Git doesn’t immediately save it. Instead, it stays in the working directory as an untracked file. You must explicitly add it to the staging area before committing the changes. This step ensures that only the files you’ve staged will be committed.</p>
<h4>Tracked vs Untracked Files</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Tracked files: These are files that Git is already tracking. If any changes are made to them, Git will recognize and monitor these changes.</li>
    <li>Untracked files: These are new files that Git has not been asked to track yet. You need to explicitly add them to the staging area to start tracking them.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 1: Check the Status of Files</h3>
<p>Before adding files, it’s a good idea to check the status of your repository. Use the following command <strong>git status</strong> to see which files are tracked or untracked:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="imgs/status.png" alt="git status command image">
    <figcaption><i>checking git status</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>Step 2: Adding Files to the Staging Area</h3>
<p>To add specific files to the staging area, use the following command <strong>git add filename
</strong>:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="imgs/singe add.png" alt="Command to add specified files to the staging area.">
    <figcaption><i>Command to add specified files to the staging area.</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you want to add all files in the project folder to the staging area, use <strong> git add .
</strong>, The dot (.) tells Git to stage all changes, including new, modified, and deleted files.</p>
<figure></figure>
    <img src="imgs/add.png" alt="Command to add all files to the staging area.">
    <figcaption><i>Command to add all files to the staging area.</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>Step 3: Confirming the Files in Staging</h3>
<p>After adding files, check the status again to confirm that they’ve been staged. Files in the staging area will now appear in green, indicating that they are ready to be committed.</p>
<figure></figure>
    <img src="imgs/git status.png" alt="Command to check status of the added files.">
    <figcaption><i>Command to check status of the added files</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<h1>Committing Changes</h1>
<p>Once you've added files to the staging area, the next step is to commit those changes. Committing in Git means permanently saving your changes to the repository's history, along with a message describing what was changed.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Step 1: Committing Your Changes</strong></li>
    <p>To commit the changes in the staging area, use the following command <strong>git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message here"
    </strong>:</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="imgs/first commit.png" alt="Command to commit changes with a descriptive message.">
        <figcaption><i>Command to commit changes with a descriptive message.</i></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The -m flag allows you to add a message to describe the changes you made in this commit. This message is crucial for understanding the history of your project.</p>
    <li>Writing Good Commit Messages</li>
    <p>Good commit messages are essential for understanding the history of your project. A clear message helps others (and your future self) understand what was changed and why.</p>
    <li><strong>Step 2: Viewing Past Commits</strong></li>
    <p>To see a history of all your past commits, use the following command: <strong>git log
    </strong><br>This will display a list of commits, including the author, date, and commit message, as well as the unique hash identifier for each commit. Here’s an example of what the output might look like:</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="imgs/git og.png" alt="Command to view commit history with details.">
        <figcaption><i>Command to view commit history with details.</i></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <li><strong>Step 3: Going Back to a Specific Commit</strong></li>
    <p>If you ever need to revert back to a previous state in your project, you can use the checkout or reset commands. Here's how to go back to a specific commit:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Identify the commit hash from the <strong>git log</strong> output (e.g., 1a2b3c4d5e6f).</li>
        <li>Use this command to check out a specific commit: <strong>git checkout 1a2b3c4d5e6f
        </strong></li>
        <p>This command will take you to the state of the project at that specific commit. Keep in mind that when you use <strong>checkout</strong>, you're in a "detached HEAD" state, meaning that changes won't affect the main project history until you return to the latest commit or branch.</p>
    </ol>
</ul>
<h1>Branches</h1>
<p>A branch in Git is like a separate version of your project where you can work on changes without affecting the main codebase. It allows you to experiment, add new features, fix bugs, or make changes in isolation. Once you're satisfied with your changes, you can merge the branch back into the main project.</p>
<h3>What is a Branch?</h3>
<p>By default, when you initialize a Git repository, you start with a single branch called main (or sometimes master). As you continue developing, you may want to work on new features or experiment without disrupting the stable version of your project. This is where branches come into play. <br>A branch is essentially a pointer to a specific commit. When you create a new branch, Git creates a copy of the main project at that moment. Any changes made on that branch will not affect the main branch until you decide to merge them back in.</p>
<h3>Why Are Branches Important?</h3>
<p>Branches allow you to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Work on new features: You can create a branch for each new feature, ensuring that the main project remains stable while you experiment.</li>
    <li>Fix bugs without disrupting the main code: If a bug is found, you can create a branch to fix it, and once it's resolved, you can merge it back.</li>
    <li>Collaborate easily: Multiple team members can work on separate branches simultaneously, merging their work when it's ready.</li>
    <li>Create organized workflows: Branches help keep your project organized, especially when multiple features and fixes are being worked on at the same time.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Creating a Branch</h1>
<p>For example, if you're working on a new feature for your project, you can create a new branch called <strong>footer</strong></p>
<figure>
    <img src="imgs/footer.png" alt="image showing creating a branch">
    <figcaption><i>creating a branch in git</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<h1>Viewing all branches</h1>
<p>To know the number of branches you have you can use the command <strong>git branch</strong></p>
<figure>
    <img src="imgs/number of branches.png" alt="check number of branches">
    <figcaption><i>command to check the number of branches available</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<h1>Switching active branches</h1>
<p>You can switch to the feature-x branch to start making changes:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="imgs/checkoutF.png" alt="git checkout command">
    <figcaption><i>switching git branch</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<h1>Merging a branch</h1>
<p>When the feature is complete and tested, you can merge it back into the <strong>main</strong> branch:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="imgs/merge.png" alt="merging branches">
    <figcaption><i>merging branches</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<b>By using branches, you can manage changes efficiently without risking the stability of your main codebase. This is why they are a core part of any Git-based workflow.</b>
<h1>Deleting a branch</h1>
<p>Once you've finished working on a branch and merged the changes back into the main codebase, you might want to delete the branch to keep your project clean and organized. Deleting branches that are no longer needed helps prevent confusion and keeps the repository tidy.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Step 1: List All Branches</li>
    <p>Before deleting a branch, it's good practice to check all existing branches. You can do this by running the following command <strong>git branch
    </strong>:</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="imgs/braanches.png" alt="showing branches">
        <figcaption><i>command to show all branches available</i></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>This will display a list of all branches in your repository, with the current branch highlighted.</p>
    <li>Step 2: Delete a Local Branch</li>
    <p>To delete a branch that is no longer needed, you can use the following command <strong>git branch -d branch-name</strong> Replace branch-name with the name of the branch you want to delete. For example, if you want to delete a branch called <strong>footer</strong>, you would run:</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="imgs/dekete.png" alt="command to delete a branch">
        <figcaption><i>command to delete a branch</i></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The <strong>-d</strong> option will delete the branch, but only if it has already been merged. If the branch has unmerged changes, Git will warn you and prevent the deletion.</p>
    <li>Step 3: Forcing Branch Deletion</li>
    <b>If you want to delete a branch that hasn’t been merged yet (and you're sure you don’t need it anymore), you can force the deletion with the <strong>-D</strong> flag usnig this command <strong>git branch -D branch-name
    </strong>:</b>
    <figure>
        <img src="imgs/force.png" alt="command to force delete a branch">
        <figcaption><i>command to force delete a branch</i></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>This will delete the branch regardless of whether it has unmerged changes. <br>Deleting branches after they are no longer needed helps maintain a clean and organized Git workflow. Whether you're working locally or with a remote repository, knowing how to delete branches ensures that your project stays manageable and avoids clutter. </p>
